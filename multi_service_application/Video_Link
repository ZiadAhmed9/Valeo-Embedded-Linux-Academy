- Both ubuntu part and rpi part contain same directories and same source codes
- RPI part have its codes compile with a different compiler 
- CMAKE is different for both 


- I downloaded boost library again with .jam file edited to cross compile successfuly with the boost logger 
- the .jam file contains this line 

`using gcc : aarch64 : aarch64-rpi4-linux-gnu-g++ ;`  and inside the CMAKElists of the rpi I have written the boost include file path manually to avoid errors

-Inside the project you will stumble across multiple readme files kindly read them for better understanding 

-Also a video demonstration is provided and some screenshots have a look at them
